Power generation is one of the most important utilities for modern communities. It is a method of generating power and energy from different sources. Energy and power is not freely available and needs to be produced, transforming other forms of energy to electricity. Power generation technologies are produced from different sources of energy such as fossil fuels, nuclear, solar, wind, and water. Production is done in power stations (likewise called "power plants"). It is used for generating electricity and solar power. Electricity is produced at a power plant by electromechanical generators, fundamentally determined by heat engines filled by burning or nuclear generators and kinetic energy. Other energy sources include solar photovoltaic and geothermal power.
