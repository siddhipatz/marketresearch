Distributed Solar Power Generation is an approach to provide solar energy resources by deploying tools and technologies in proximity to the end users of the power. The system for power generation can be installed on rooftops of houses and commercial buildings that will use the energy. This method is in contrast with centralized generation where solar electricity is produced by a large plant and then distributed to consumers through the power grid. Also, the surplus energy produced by individual owners (through solar) can be sold to the power companies.
